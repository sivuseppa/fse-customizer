# FSE Customizer

A WordPress plugin that adds a customizer menu item to the admin menu for Full Site Editing (FSE) themes.

## Description

With the introduction of Full Site Editing (FSE) themes in WordPress, the traditional Customizer interface has been moved to the background in favor of the Site Editor. However, many users still prefer to use the familiar Customizer interface for certain tasks.

This plugin adds a "Customize" menu item under the **Appearance** menu in the WordPress admin dashboard, providing easy access to the traditional Customizer (`wp-admin/customize.php`) even when using FSE themes.
